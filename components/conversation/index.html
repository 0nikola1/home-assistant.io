<p>The conversation component can process sentences into commands for Home Assistant. It is currently limited to parsing commands in the format <code>turn &lt;Friendly Name&gt; &lt;on/off&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>To enable the conversion option in your installation, add the following to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment"># Example configuration.yaml entry</span>
<span class="key">conversation</span>:
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When this component is active and you are using a supported browser voice commands will be activated in the frontend. Browse to <a href="/demo/">the demo</a> in Chrome to see it in action.</p>

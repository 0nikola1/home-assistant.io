    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Two weeks ago, September 17 marked our 3 year anniversary. In this time Home Assistant managed to grow from a simple script that turned on my lights when the sun set to a kick ass open source project with the best community an open-source project could wish for. This release contains features, bug fixes and performance tweaks by a total of **50** different people! We have also managed to cross the 1000 forks on GitHub. Talking about momentum!

This is a big release as we've completely overhauled the internals of Home Assistant. When I initially wrote Home Assistant, still figuring out the ins and outs of Python, I went for an approach that I was familiar with for an application with many moving parts: threads and locks. This approach has served us well over the years but it was slower than it needed to be, especially on limited hardware.

This all changed when [@bbangert] came around and took on the tough job to migrate the core over to use asynchronous programming. He did an amazing job and I am happy to say that the initial port has been done and is included in this release! On top of that, we have been able to keep our simple and straightforward API at the same time. We are still in the process of migrating more and more components over to the asynchronous API, so expect more speedups and awesome features in the upcoming releases.

### <a class='title-link' name='sleepiq-and-openalpr' href='#sleepiq-and-openalpr'></a> SleepIQ and OpenALPR 

There now is support for two new super cool things: Beds and license plates. [@technicalpickles] created a [SleepIQ] component that let you monitor the sensor data of your bed. [@pvizeli] has added license plate recognition based on [OpenALPR]! This means that you can now be notified about which car is parked on your driveway or in your garage. I also would like to use this opportunity to give a big shoutout to [@pvizeli] for being such an awesome member of our community. He joined us at the end of June and has helped crush bugs and add awesome features ever since (65 pull requests already!).

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 

On the voluptuous front we have also made great progress. We were able to fully remove the legacy config helpers and have migrated 323 of the 346 components and platforms that needed migrating! This does mean that for some components the configuration has slightly changed, make sure to check out the breaking changes section at the bottom for more info. Thanks everybody for reviewing the Pull requests, testing the changes, and reporting issues.

### <a class='title-link' name='delayed-release' href='#delayed-release'></a> Delayed Release 

As you might have noticed, this release has been delayed by 5 days. This was due to a rare, difficult to reproduce problem with the Python interpreter. A huuuuge thanks to all the people that have helped countless hours in researching, debugging and fixing this issue: [@bbangert], [@turbokongen], [@lwis], [@kellerza], [@technicalpickles], [@pvizeli], [@persandstrom] and [@joyrider3774]. I am grateful to have all of you as part of the Home Assistant community.

### <a class='title-link' name='hide-automation-rules' href='#hide-automation-rules'></a> Hide automation rules 

Since 0.28 [automation rules](/blog/2016/09/10/notify-group-reload-api-pihole/#reload-automation-rules) can be reloaded directly from the frontend. By default all automation rules are shown. If you want to [hide an automation rule](/getting-started/automation-create-first/), use `hide_entity: True`.

    <updated>2016-09-10T06:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/09/10/notify-group-reload-api-pihole</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's already time for 0.28 thanks to our super short release cycles. Now, it' official...we hit 4000 stars on Github. That's amazing. Sorry, not as amazing as all the stuff that was going on for 0.27 but still pretty awesome.

### <a class='title-link' name='reload-automation-rules' href='#reload-automation-rules'></a> Reload automation rules 

This release brings you a huge improvement of the [automation] and [group] handling. Both can be reloaded without a Home Assistant restart by calling their new reload services. The automations can be controlled directly from the frontend.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/automation-switches.png' />
</p>

### <a class='title-link' name='raspberry-pi-installation-guide' href='#raspberry-pi-installation-guide'></a> Raspberry Pi installation guide 
Singleboard computers are very popular to run Home Assistant. To support this fact, the [installation documentation][rpi] for the Raspberry Pi devices was re-written to get users started as quickly as possible. [@Landrash] took the lead with on this tasks with help from [@kellerza] and [@MartinHjelmare]. 

### <a class='title-link' name='climate-and--cover' href='#climate-and--cover'></a> Climate and  cover 
There are countless bugfixes included in this release which will make your experience with the `climate` and the `cover` platforms better. Two week ago was the biggest merger of implementations released that ever happened in the history of Home Assistant. Thanks to [@turbokongen], [@pvizeli], [@djbanks], [@danielperna84], and others the improvements on the code and the frontend side is continuing... 

### <a class='title-link' name='api-documentation' href='#api-documentation'></a> API documentation 
The [Home Assistant API Documentation](https://dev-docs.home-assistant.io/en/dev/) is a great addition to the already exisiting user documentation. The focus is not end-users but developers who whant to get details about the code without actually browsing the code on Github.

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 
The validation of the configuration is still on-going. Approximatly 80 % is done. This means that we will propably talk about this topic in the next release notes again. To align the configuration of components and platforms we needed to break some. Please refer to the Breaking changes section to check if you need to update your configuration or simple check your log for configuration validation errors. Thanks to [@kellerza], [@fabaff], [@Teagan42], and [@pvizeli] for your effort!

- Updates of configuration variables due to configuration check or alignment with other platforms. Please update your configuration entries according to the documentation:
  - [OctoPrint] component
  - mFi platform ([switch][mfi-switch] and [sensor][mfi-sensor])
  - NX584 Alarm Control Panel
  - Mediaplayer platforms [FireTV], [Kodi] and [MPD]
  - [switch][command-line-switch] and the [cover][command-line-cover] `command_line` platforms
- Custom components extending `BaseNotificationService` need to be aware that `kwargs.get(ATTR_TITLE)` will now return `None` if a title has not been set, and will need to specify `kwargs.get(ATTR_TITLE, ATTR_TITLE_DEFAULT)` if they always require a title.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This week's blog post could only be possibly described by exactly one hashtag:

# #Amazing

<sup>or <sup>maybe<sup>#supersized</sup></sup></sup>

Keep reading to see what **#Amazing** things we have in store for you this week 😄! And make sure you read all the way to the end, because I left a present down there for those committed few among you :)

But first...

## <a class='title-link' name='some-general-housekeeping' href='#some-general-housekeeping'></a> Some general housekeeping 

Paulus ([@balloob]) is on vacation in Europe this week, so you will all have to deal with me, Robbie ([@robbiet480]) for this release blog post. Don't worry, Paulus will be back to tearing apart your pull requests in no time 😈.

Special thanks to my awesome helpers for this week's release who are looking over my shoulder to make sure I'm crossing my t's and dotting my i's: [@Teagan42], [@infamy] and [@fabaff].

For my next trick, let's hand out some...

## <a class='title-link' name='trophies' href='#trophies'></a> Trophies 

I felt that I had to 1-up Paulus ([@balloob]) somehow with his 500,000 pageviews stat he shared in the [0.26 blog post](/blog/2016/08/13/foursquare-fast-com-ffmpeg-gpsd/), so I pushed myself and our development community as a whole super hard the last two weeks to put a lot of love into Home Assistant to bring you not just one, but six **#Amazing** stats for this release. As of 0.27, we have now surpassed the following milestones:

* [10,000](https://travis-ci.org/home-assistant/home-assistant/builds/154660811) builds on Travis (congrats to [@BluGeni])

Now that we have that great news out of the way, onto this week's release which is going to keep the **#Amazing** gravy train rolling right along and get to the stuff you all _really_ are here for.

## <a class='title-link' name='027' href='#027'></a> 0.27 

While this release is **#Amazing**, we had to break a few eggs (now you understand the title reference!) to make a beautiful omelette (using home automation obviously) so some platforms and components have needed to introduce breaking changes. Please make sure to read the [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section below.

### <a class='title-link' name='hue-bridge-emulation' href='#hue-bridge-emulation'></a> Hue Bridge Emulation 
Thanks to [@mgbowen] we now have the functionality previously provided by [@blocke]'s [ha-local-echo](https://github.com/blocke/ha-local-echo) [built right into Home Assistant](/components/emulated_hue/)! This means that for those of you with devices that either lack or have a subpar integration with Home Assistant (looking at you Amazon Echo) you can now have a better experience by having your Home Assistant pretend to be a Hue Bridge. Personally, I have used [@auchter]'s [Haaska](https://github.com/auchter/haaska) previously but found that it was slow to respond and sometimes failed entirely. With the new [`emulated_hue`](/components/emulated_hue/) component, you can have local control of entities through Amazon Echo.

### <a class='title-link' name='notification-improvements' href='#notification-improvements'></a> Notification improvements 
We have some excellent upgrades to the notification system coming to you in 0.27, courtesy of me, [@robbiet480].

#### <a class='title-link' name='html5-push-notifications' href='#html5-push-notifications'></a> HTML5 Push Notifications 
This release adds support for [HTML5] push notifications on Chrome/Firefox/Opera on both desktop and Android devices. This means that you can send a notification to your phone even when your Home Assistant is not open in your mobile browser. When using Chrome you can even include 2 action buttons so that you can control your Home Assistant from your phone's lock screen, allowing you to do things like sound alarms or unlock your front door, all without leaving the notification. Thanks again to me ([@robbiet480]) and Paulus ([@balloob]) for all the hard work on this!

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/html5-notify.png' />
</p>

#### <a class='title-link' name='notification-groups' href='#notification-groups'></a> Notification Groups 
Using the new notify `group` platform allows you to cut down a lot of duplicate automation logic by combining multiple notification platforms and `target`s into a single notify service. Check out the [docs](/components/notify.group/) for more info.

#### <a class='title-link' name='target-is-no-longer-needed' href='#target-is-no-longer-needed'></a> `target` is no longer needed! 
For platforms that support it, starting with the new HTML5 platform, any `target`s that are available will be exposed as individual services, so no more having to remember which `target`s to use. Please note that the existing services also still exist so you can keep using `target` if you wish.

### <a class='title-link' name='validate-configuration-before-restarting-home-assistant' href='#validate-configuration-before-restarting-home-assistant'></a> Validate configuration before restarting Home Assistant 
Ever restarted Home Assistant to test a configuration change just to find out there is a validation error? Well, not anymore! [@kellerza] has added a command line script that will validate your configuration as if you started Home Assistant.

```bash
$ hass --script check_config
```

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 
This release includes a big push on making sure all platforms contain proper configuration validation. This should help in getting your configuration right. Thanks to [@fabaff], [@pavoni], [@pvizeli], [@nkgilley] for all the hard work on this, you all rock!

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/config-validation.png' />
</p>

### <a class='title-link' name='ffmpeg-motionnoise-sensing' href='#ffmpeg-motionnoise-sensing'></a> FFMpeg motion/noise sensing 
It's now possible to use [FFMpeg] to monitor a video stream and detect motion thanks to a new binary sensor platform by [@pvizeli].

### <a class='title-link' name='component-clean-up---thermostat--hvac---climate-rollershutter--garage-door---cover' href='#component-clean-up---thermostat--hvac---climate-rollershutter--garage-door---cover'></a> Component clean up - Thermostat & HVAC -> Climate. Rollershutter & Garage Door -> Cover. 
Due to our wild growth we ended up with a few components that had a lot of overlapping functionality. [@turbokongen] took on the hard job on merging them. Thermostat and HVAC platforms are now combined under the new Climate component. Rollershutter and Garage Door platforms are now combined under the new Cover component. You can easily upgrade by just swapping out the name. For example replace `thermostat` with `climate`. The old components have been deprecated and will be removed in the near future.

### <a class='title-link' name='a-new-fan-component' href='#a-new-fan-component'></a> A new `fan` component 
Along with the new `climate` component, [@Teagan42] and I ([@robbiet480]) decided we needed something simpler to just control a fan. Currently it has support for controlling Insteon fans. MQTT support will appear in 0.28.0. I tried to get it implemented before 0.27.0 but spent too long writing this blog post 😢.

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 
- Ecobee3 occupancy sensors have moved from sensor platform to binary sensor platform.
- Forecast.io entity IDs are now like `sensor.forecastio_temperature`. Previously they were like `sensor.weather_temperature`. Apologies for this change, but we needed to make Forecast.io more generic now that we have many weather platforms.
- The [Loop Energy][Loop] sensor configuration format changed slightly, please reformat based on the revised documentation.
- The configuration for the [SABnzbd] sensor has slightly changed. The prefix `type:` is no longer required for monitored variables.
- The [IMAP] sensor now uses `username` instead of `user`.
- The [NZBGet] sensor has had so many changes I can't list them all. Please refer to the documentation for more info.

### <a class='title-link' name='deprecations' href='#deprecations'></a> Deprecations 
- Using the `thermostat` and `hvac` components has been deprecated. Please migrate to the new `climate` component. (just change the component name, the configurations are compatible)
- Using the `rollershutter` and `garage_door` components have also been deprecated. Please migrate to the new `cover` component. (just change the component name, the configurations are compatible)

## <a class='title-link' name='finishing-up' href='#finishing-up'></a> Finishing up 

Thanks all for sticking with me to the end. I'll be taking over a lot of Paulus's ([@balloob]) work while he is gone, but as I said, don't worry because he'll be back well before 0.28.0 comes out. Hopefully you didn't find this jovial blog post too jarring from our standard style, I just wrote a lot of this at 2am after being awake for almost 20 hours, so I'm a little loopy hahaha 😴.

Also, thanks as always to our developer contributors, documentation contributors, but most of all our users! This would've just been a script that Paulus (@balloob) used to control his lights at home if we didn't have your enthusiasm.

Feel free to let me know what you thought of this blog post and release on Gitter or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robbie), or even the [Home Assistant Twitter](https://twitter.com/home_assistant). Did I mention we have a brand new [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/homeassistantio) that you should absolutely Like? There's a convenient Facebook Like and Twitter follow button right on the sidebar.

I almost forgot about your 🎁 for reading all the way to here: a 🍪! Hope you enjoy it in good health 😄.

Talk to you soon on Gitter and in your pull request comments!

    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/08/13/foursquare-fast-com-ffmpeg-gpsd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's time for 0.26 and it's again full of new features and fixes. First I want to highlight that we are now having 500 000 monthly pageviews on the website. A big milestone for us! It's been an amazing journey. Big thanks to the Home Assistant community for being such a delightful bunch.

This release includes code contributed by 31 different people. The biggest change in this release is a new unit system. Instead of picking Celsius or Fahrenheit you'll have to pick imperial or metric now. This influences the units for your temperature, distance, and weight. This will simplify any platform or component that needs to know this information. Big thanks to [@Teagan42] for her hard work on this!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[When Home Assistant started the focus has always been on making a great developer experience. Allowing anyone to add support for their favorite devices to Home Assistant easily. This focus has been a great success since we now have 339 components and platforms!

Starting with this release, we are extending our extensability to the frontend. Starting this release, any component can [add it's own page to the frontend][custom-panels]. Examples of this today are the map, logbook and history. We are looking forward to all the crazy panels you'll come up with!

We have also seen an exciting trend of people starting to visualize their Internet of Things data using [Jupyter] Notebooks, which are a great way to create and share documents that contain code, visualizations, and explanatory text. In case you missed it, the [blog] post by [@kireyeu] shows an advanced usecase while our [Notebooks][jupyter-notebooks] in the [Home Assistant Notebooks repository][jupyter-repo] cover the basics.

This release also includes a bunch of new integrations, among others three new media player platforms. This means that today Home Assistant can talk to 26 different media players!

The brand-new [iFrame panel component][iframe_panel] allows you to add other websites as pages in the Home Assistant frontend. They will show up in the sidebar and can be used the same way as you open the frontend in your browser but all within one view.

I would like to do a shoutout to [@fabianhjr]. He has started adding [typing] data ([PEP484]) to the Home Assistant core. This will help us identify issues before they are released.

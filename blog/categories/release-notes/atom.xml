    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href='https://home-assistant.io/components/#added_in_current_version/'><img src='https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-03-0.40/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

It's time for version 0.40 already! For this version, the main focus was on performance and bug fixes. Big thanks to [@pvizeli] for driving this effort. Startup is now super fast. We have also continued with adding warnings for components and platforms that are slowing down Home Assistant.

Some people have interpreted our recent added warnings as if 0.39 introduced the issues that caused the warning. This is not the case, the platforms and components have been misbehaving for a while but now we are adding warnings so we are able to track down the culprits.

Before we continue talking about all the improvements in this release I want to take a moment to thank a few people from the Home Assistant community that are fundamental to the success of Home Assistant. Big thanks to [@dale3h], [@CCOSTAN], [@skalavala], [@rrubin0], [@brahmafear], [@bassclarinetl2], and [@torn8o]! These are all people that hang out in our [main chat channel] and help new users get started and help existing users when running into trouble. Home Assistant would not be there without all the effort you put in! ðŸ™‡

And that our community kicks ass is also shown in the numbers. We have already raised together over $700 for the [EFF] via the sale of [our t-shirts][hass-shirt]! All of you rock! Another number worth mentioning is that this release brings us passed 600 integrations for Home Assistant. All of you rock, again!

## Z-Wave is now threadsafe

[@andrey-git] has spend a lot of time to make Z-Wave perform better. It should no longer cause Home Assistant to run slower or raise warnings about the timer getting out of sync.

## Update on the MQTT Out of Memory errors in 0.39

MQTT started causing "Out of Memory" errors for some people on a Raspberry Pi. We have been able to track this down to Raspberry Pis that are using an older firmware. If you are experiencing this issue, please [upgrade your firmware using `rpi-update`](https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update#installing).

## Turn any Android phone into an IP Camera

With the new support for [IP Webcam](/components/android_ip_webcam/) added by [@robbiet480] and [@pvizeli] you are now able to re-purpose any Android phone to become a multifunctional IP webcam. Some of the cool things that you can do:

 - Integrate the Android device camera
 - Binary sensor when motion is detected
 - Sensors to expose the device sensors, including pressure, sound, battery, light
 - Control device features like the GPS, night vision and camera flash

</p>

## Other Highlights

 - Support added for Austrian weather using Zamg weather data ([@Zac-HD])
 - Ring.com video doorbell integration added ([@tchellomello])
 - Blink Home Security Camera support added ([@fronzbot])
 - AppleTV has been converted to push data to Home Assistant instead of us having to poll ([@postlund])

## Breaking changes

- Vera entity ids have changed. This is a one time change to migrate to a model that will prevent future conflicts.
- The Twilio notify platforms now have to be configured via the twilio component.

```yaml
twilio:
  account_sid: "abc"
  auth_token: "xyz"
```

- If you are using async custom components, the passed in `async_add_devices` method is now a callback instead of a coroutine function.

### If you need help...

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's time for 0.39 and this release has some amazing new features!

<a href='https://home-assistant.io/components/#added_in_current_version/'><img src='https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-02-0.39/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

## T-Shirts

First off, in case you haven't seen it yet: [we have t-shirts][t-shirt] now and they are beautiful. All proceeds from the shirts will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The first three days all of you have already raised $400! Still waiting for Teespring to get back to me so stay tuned for the EU store.

## Configuration panel

Yep, you read that right. We have a configuration panel. It's just the first of many small steps. Putting in a foundation is important and gives us something to iterate on.

To start, we have three simple configuration panels:

 - Core: allows you to validate config, reload core/group/automation config and restart/stop Home Assistant
 - Group: allows you to rename groups, change type between group/view and reorder entities.
 - Z-Wave: allows you to set device specific configuration settings

<p class='img'>
  <img src='https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-02-0.39/config.png'>
  Screenshot of our new configuration panel.
</p>

As a security measure, the configuration panel will need to be activated in the config file to be activated. This can be done by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
config:
```

Using our configuration panels will require you to structure your groups and Z-Wave device config according to how the configuration panel expects it. This is on purpose as it we will not be aiming to build a system that supports both our extended set of configuration extend hooks and our configuration panels. It's one or the other.

To activate them in your config, create empty files `groups.yaml` and `zwave_device_config.yaml` in your config dir and add the following entries to your config:

```yaml
group: !include groups.yaml

zwave:
  device_config: !include zwave_device_config.yaml
```

_Note that this is the first release. Things will be missing, things might be broken._

## Reorganized documentation

Thanks to [Fabian][@fabaff] we have a great re-organized documentation. Is it perfect yet? No. But we are getting close. We put a lot of focus on making sure the Raspberry Pi is the main focus of our getting started. The other instructions are still available, just not as part of the main getting started.

## State restoration

Ever have some input components or integrations and get annoyed with the fact that their state is lost after a restart? Don't worry any longer. [Johann][@kellerza] has added the foundation for state restoration to Home Assistant. For the initial release support has been added to to `input_select` and `input_boolean` components. We will be adding this to more integrations in the future.

## Breaking changes to customize and Z-Wave "customize"

A couple of releases ago we introduced a new way of doing `customize`. It became a list that allowed different ways of matching the config to the entity.

We realized that this was leading into a rabbit hole that we had to get out off. Besides making it unnecessarily complicated it also blocked the road to config panels. And who doesn't like config panels?

So starting this release, we had to make some breaking changes to right the wrong. We will be releasing an online tool to help you convert your config to the new format later today.

[**Update: the online tool can be found here.**](https://jsfiddle.net/balloob/d2e56q6f/74/)

#### Customize has been reverted to it's original config

The old customize is back. The options to match by domain or using glob have been moved to it's own options. It will now look like this:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
    light.kitchen:
      hidden: true
  customize_domain:
    light:
      icon: mdi:home
  customize_glob:
    "light.kitchen_*":
      icon: mid:description
```

#### Z-Wave customize is now device config

Ever wondered why the Z-Wave customize was called customize? Yeah, so did we. So when migrating this to the new config format, we decided to upgrade the name too:

```yaml
zwave:
  device_config:
    light.kitchen:
      ignored: true
  device_config_domain:
    light:
      polling_intensity: 2
  device_config_glob:
    "light.kitchen_*":
      polling_intensity: 0
```

## Speed improvements

And a final shout out to [Pascal][@pvizeli]. He keeps improving the performance of components and platforms all over Home Assistant.

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/11/alert-appletv-mqtt-yeelight/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-11T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/11/alert-appletv-mqtt-yeelight</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Another Saturday, another release!

### <a class='title-link' name='core-updates' href='#core-updates'></a> Core updates 
- Thanks to [@pvizeli], all the core components are now written asynchronously. All entity components are now migrated from synchronously to asynchronously code!

- Now when you restart Home Assistant using the `homeassistant.restart` service, your configuration is checked. If it appears to be invalid the restart will fail.

### <a class='title-link' name='rewritten-frontend' href='#rewritten-frontend'></a> Rewritten frontend 
The frontend has been completely been rewritten, optimizing for speed and lost connection recovery. Even on the slowest phones it should fly now. The frontend also now uses the new [WebSockets API][websocket-api] instead of the [EventStream API][event-stream-api].

### <a class='title-link' name='custom-state-card-ui' href='#custom-state-card-ui'></a> Custom state card UI 
A nice new feature is the possibility to create [custom state cards][custom-ui] in the frontend. Go ahead and write your own state card for [lights][light], sensors, locks, etc.

### <a class='title-link' name='mqtt-discovery' href='#mqtt-discovery'></a> MQTT discovery 
MQTT now has [discovery][mqtt-discovery] support which is different than our [`discovery`][discovery] component. Similar to the HTTP sensor and HTTP binary sensor, MQTT discovery removes the need for configuration by allowing devices to make their presence known to Home Assistant.

### <a class='title-link' name='alert-component' href='#alert-component'></a> Alert component 
If you left your front door open, then the new [`alert`][alert] component can be used to remind you of this by sending you repeating notifications at a given interval.

### <a class='title-link' name='yeelight' href='#yeelight'></a> Yeelight 
The [`yeelight`][yeelight] component has been ported to use a more stable and feature-complete [python-yeelight][python-yeelight] backend, and supports now both white and RGB bulbs. The component also supports transitions and can be configured to save the settings to the bulb on changes. The users currently using custom components for Yeelight are encouraged to move back to use the included version and report any problems with it to our [issue tracker][issue].

### <a class='title-link' name='apple-tv' href='#apple-tv'></a> Apple TV 
[Apple TV][apple-tv] is now a supported [`media_player`][media-player]! It has support for just about every media player function, including a realtime display of playback status and artwork.

### <a class='title-link' name='all-changes' href='#all-changes'></a> All changes

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 
- The support for [LG webOS Smart TVs][webostv] was improved. This requires you to move `$HOME/.pylgtv` to `$HASS_CONFIG_DIR/webostv.conf` or Home Assistant will need to be paired with the TV again.
- Image processing events have been renamed: `identify_face` has become `image_processing.detect_face`, `found_plate` has become `image_processing.found_plate`
- The [FFmpeg binary sensor][ffmpeg-bin] change the platform name from `ffmpeg` to `ffmpeg_noise` and `ffmpeg_motion`. Also all FFmpeg-related services are moved from a platform implementation to a the [FFmpeg components][ffmpeg] and were rename from `binary_sensor.ffmpeg_xy` to `ffmpeg.xy`.
- The frontend core changes have caused all custom panels to break. Docs have not been updated yet. The gist is that you have to use `this.hass.entities`, `this.hass.callService` and `this.hass.callApi`.

    <updated>2017-01-28T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/28/face-coffee-wink</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[No stats, no numbers, and alike this time. Ok, just one number: 0.37. We are back on track with our bi-weekly release cycle. Beside some organizational changes is this release shipping again cool features and new integrations. Please keep an eye on the "Breaking changes" section because there are also massive improvements for some platforms and components.

### <a class='title-link' name='governance' href='#governance'></a> Governance 
As announced, the new [Governance][gov] requires for developers to sign the CLA. [Code of Conduct][coc], [Contributor License Agreement][cla], and proper [Licensing][license] will to protect all involved parties in the Home Assistant eco-system from users and community members to contributors. 

### <a class='title-link' name='face-recognition-using-the-microsoft-face-api' href='#face-recognition-using-the-microsoft-face-api'></a> Face recognition using the Microsoft Face API 
[@pvizeli] has been on a roll with the image processing integrations. This time it's the [Microsoft Face API][face]. This means that now it will be possible to train the API with the people you want to recognize and send images from your camera to the API as another source of automation.

Want to play a personalized tune when someone enters the house? It is now possible ðŸ˜Ž

### <a class='title-link' name='improved-camera-security' href='#improved-camera-security'></a> Improved camera security 

After a security audit by Stephen O'Conner, he found that our source for randomly generated access tokens for camera feeds were reasonable predictable and could be brute force attacked in 2.5 weeks. A fix has been included in this release that uses the system provided random number generator for maximum randomness and rotates the keys every 10 minutes to reduce the window in which a brute force attack can happen.

Although the old method is not insecure, the new method is a lot more secure. Upgrading to the latest version is encouraged.

### <a class='title-link' name='new-customization-options' href='#new-customization-options'></a> New customization options 
[@Andrey-git] has added some great new options to the customize functionality. It is now possible to specify customizations as a wildcard for entities or for a specific domain.

### <a class='title-link' name='major-wink-and-hdmi-cec-improvements' href='#major-wink-and-hdmi-cec-improvements'></a> Major Wink and HDMI CEC improvements 
[@w1ll1am23] did an amazing job fixing a ton of bugs and issues with the Wink integration. Biggest improvement is that it now is able to automatically refresh the authentication tokens. This means that if you have your email address and password in your `configuration.yaml` file, no `client_id` and `client_secret` are needed, and token which was generated with the generator located in the [Wink][wink] documentation.

The new Wink support will cause renaming of all the binary sensors and will also create new sensors for devices that weren't previously detected or supported in the older version. 

Thanks to [@konikvranik] the [HDMI CEC][cec] integration got a huge update with a lot of improvements. This update should make it easier to work with HDMI CEC and give you more control.

### <a class='title-link' name='first-coffee-maker-supported' href='#first-coffee-maker-supported'></a> First Coffee Maker supported 
[@stu-gott] has added support for the first coffee maker in Home Assistant: [Mr. Coffee Smart Optimal Brew][coffee]. Happy brewing!

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 
- A **major** breaking change in the [`emulated_hue`][emul-hue] component means that unless you set `type: alexa` before starting up the newer Home Assistant version you will lose all devices that Alexa has discovered and will need to re-add them as well as create new groups.
- The platform of the [ISS][iss] integration was change to `binary_sensor`. Please check the platform documentation.
- The [Roku][roku] media uses now a new format for the entity IDs.
- [OpenALPR][openalpr] is no longer a component. It's now a platform for [Image processing][image].
- Due to massive improvements of the [Wink][wink] integration, the names of your binary sensors will change and new devices can show up.
- The [MySensors][mysensors] component now requires all persistence file paths to be set if any is set by the user. This is to avoid name conflicts for the paths. If no path is set Home Assistant will set all paths for you.
- The [Sonos][sonos] service `sonos_group_players` was removed. Use now `sonos_join` for this function.
- TTS cache have change for the last time. Files use now also a option hash as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_OPTIONS_PLATFORM.xxx`, replace *OPTIONS* with `-` on exiting platforms.

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-14T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to 2017 and 0.36. We are proud to announce the first release for this year. While we are still migrating parts to async but 0.36 is focusing on new features and a lot of bug fixes.

### <a class='title-link' name='packages' href='#packages'></a> Packages 
[Packages][packages] are providing a new way to organize different component's configuration parts together. With packages we offer the option to include different components or parts of configuration using any of the `!include` directives.

### <a class='title-link' name='influxdb-export' href='#influxdb-export'></a> InfluxDB export 
The [InfluxDB][influx] component was causing problems in a wide variety of use cases. [@titilambert] improved our InfluxDB exporter feature. It might be that you need to run the [migration script](/components/influxdb/#migration-script) to update your InfluxDB database.

```bash
$ hass --script influxdb_migrator \
    -H IP_INFLUXDB_HOST -u INFLUXDB_USERNAME -p INFLUXDB_PASSWORD \
    -d INFLUXDB_DB_NAME
```

### <a class='title-link' name='international-space-station-iss' href='#international-space-station-iss'></a> International Space Station (ISS) 
No, unfortunately we are not going to space. The `iss` sensor is tracking the position of the International Space Station and gives you some details.

### <a class='title-link' name='insteon-local' href='#insteon-local'></a> Insteon local 
The support for Insteon was removed due to issues a while ago. With the `insteon_local` component support for [Insteon][insteon] is back and let one work locally with an Insteon setup.

### <a class='title-link' name='image-processing' href='#image-processing'></a> Image processing 
The new [image processing component][image] currently works with [number plates][plates]. But this could level the way to integrate feature like facial recognition, motion detection, or gestures control.

- [APNS][apns] service was moved to the `notify` domain. Use `notify.apns_NOTIFIER_NAME` instead of `apns.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
- [InfluxDB][influx] component has a new [schema](/components/influxdb/#data-migration) to store values in the InfluxDB database. You may require to run the [`influxdb_migrator`](/components/influxdb/#migration-script) script.
  You have to note:
  - There will not be any tags/fields named time anymore.
  - All numeric fields (int/float/bool) will be stored as float inside influx db.
  - All string fields corresponding to state attributes will be renamed as FIELDNAME_str, where FIELDNAME is the state attribute, to avoid type conflicts.
  - All string fields corresponding to a state will be renamed as state (former value).
  - Fields named value will always be stored as float.
  - Fields named state will always be stored as string.
- TTS cache files use now the language abbreviation as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx`.

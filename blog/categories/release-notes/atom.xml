    <content type="html"><![CDATA[No stats, no numbers, and alike this time. Ok, just one number: 0.37. We are back on track with our bi-weekly release cycle. Beside some organizational changes is this release shipping again cool features and new integrations. Please keep an eye on the "Breaking changes" section because there are also massive improvements for some platforms and components.

### <a class='title-link' name='governance' href='#governance'></a> Governance 
As announced, the new [Governance][gov] requires for developers to sign the CLA. [Code of Conduct][coc], [Contributor License Agreement][cla], and proper [Licensing][license] will to protect all involved parties in the Home Assistant eco-system from users and community members to contributors. 

### <a class='title-link' name='face-recognition-using-the-microsoft-face-api' href='#face-recognition-using-the-microsoft-face-api'></a> Face recognition using the Microsoft Face API 
[@pvizeli] has been on a roll with the image processing integrations. This time it's the [Microsoft Face API][face]. This means that now it will be possible to train the API with the people you want to recognize and send images from your camera to the API as another source of automation.

Want to play a personalized tune when someone enters the house? It is now possible ðŸ˜Ž

### <a class='title-link' name='improved-camera-security' href='#improved-camera-security'></a> Improved camera security 

After a security audit by Stephen O'Conner, he found that our source for randomly generated access tokens for camera feeds were reasonable predictable and could be brute force attacked in 2.5 weeks. A fix has been included in this release that uses the system provided random number generator for maximum randomness and rotates the keys every 10 minutes to reduce the window in which a brute force attack can happen.

Although the old method is not insecure, the new method is a lot more secure. Upgrading to the latest version is encouraged.

### <a class='title-link' name='new-customization-options' href='#new-customization-options'></a> New customization options 
[@Andrey-git] has added some great new options to the customize functionality. It is now possible to specify customizations as a wildcard for entities or for a specific domain.

### <a class='title-link' name='major-wink-and-hdmi-cec-improvements' href='#major-wink-and-hdmi-cec-improvements'></a> Major Wink and HDMI CEC improvements 
[@w1ll1am23] did an amazing job fixing a ton of bugs and issues with the Wink integration. Biggest improvement is that it now is able to automatically refresh the authentication tokens. This means that if you have your email address and password in your `configuration.yaml` file, no `client_id` and `client_secret` are needed, and token which was generated with the generator located in the [Wink][wink] documentation.

The new Wink support will cause renaming of all the binary sensors and will also create new sensors for devices that weren't previously detected or supported in the older version. 

Thanks to [@konikvranik] the [HDMI CEC][cec] integration got a huge update with a lot of improvements. This update should make it easier to work with HDMI CEC and give you more control.

### <a class='title-link' name='first-coffee-maker-supported' href='#first-coffee-maker-supported'></a> First Coffee Maker supported 
[@stu-gott] has added support for the first coffee maker in Home Assistant: [Mr. Coffee Smart Optimal Brew][coffee]. Happy brewing!

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 
- A **major** breaking change in the [`emulated_hue`][emul-hue] component means that unless you set `type: alexa` before starting up the newer Home Assistant version you will lose all devices that Alexa has discovered and will need to re-add them as well as create new groups.
- The platform of the [ISS][iss] integration was change to `binary_sensor`. Please check the platform documentation.
- The [Roku][roku] media uses now a new format for the entity IDs.
- [OpenALPR][openalpr] is no longer a component. It's now a platform for [Image processing][image].
- Due to massive improvements of the [Wink][wink] integration, the names of your binary sensors will change and new devices can show up.
- The [MySensors][mysensors] component now requires all persistence file paths to be set if any is set by the user. This is to avoid name conflicts for the paths. If no path is set Home Assistant will set all paths for you.
- The [Sonos][sonos] service `sonos_group_players` was removed. Use now `sonos_join` for this function.
- TTS cache have change for the last time. Files use now also a option hash as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_OPTIONS_PLATFORM.xxx`, replace *OPTIONS* with `-` on exiting platforms.

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-14T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to 2017 and 0.36. We are proud to announce the first release for this year. While we are still migrating parts to async but 0.36 is focusing on new features and a lot of bug fixes.

### <a class='title-link' name='packages' href='#packages'></a> Packages 
[Packages][packages] are providing a new way to organize different component's configuration parts together. With packages we offer the option to include different components or parts of configuration using any of the `!include` directives.

### <a class='title-link' name='influxdb-export' href='#influxdb-export'></a> InfluxDB export 
The [InfluxDB][influx] component was causing problems in a wide variety of use cases. [@titilambert] improved our InfluxDB exporter feature. It might be that you need to run the [migration script](/components/influxdb/#migration-script) to update your InfluxDB database.

```bash
$ hass --script influxdb_migrator \
    -H IP_INFLUXDB_HOST -u INFLUXDB_USERNAME -p INFLUXDB_PASSWORD \
    -d INFLUXDB_DB_NAME
```

### <a class='title-link' name='international-space-station-iss' href='#international-space-station-iss'></a> International Space Station (ISS) 
No, unfortunately we are not going to space. The `iss` sensor is tracking the position of the International Space Station and gives you some details.

### <a class='title-link' name='insteon-local' href='#insteon-local'></a> Insteon local 
The support for Insteon was removed due to issues a while ago. With the `insteon_local` component support for [Insteon][insteon] is back and let one work locally with an Insteon setup.

### <a class='title-link' name='image-processing' href='#image-processing'></a> Image processing 
The new [image processing component][image] currently works with [number plates][plates]. But this could level the way to integrate feature like facial recognition, motion detection, or gestures control.

- [InfluxDB][influx] component has a new [schema](/components/influxdb/#data-migration) to store values in the InfluxDB database. You may require to run the [`influxdb_migrator`](/components/influxdb/#migration-script) script.
  You have to note:
  - There will not be any tags/fields named time anymore.
  - All numeric fields (int/float/bool) will be stored as float inside influx db.
  - All string fields corresponding to state attributes will be renamed as FIELDNAME_str, where FIELDNAME is the state attribute, to avoid type conflicts.
  - All string fields corresponding to a state will be renamed as state (former value).
  - Fields named value will always be stored as float.
  - Fields named state will always be stored as string.
- TTS cache files use now the language abbreviation as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx`.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[5000 stars on GitHub, 2000 people in out Gitter chatroom and over a million monthly page views. I don't think we could wish for a better place to be at the end of 2016. Feels like an early Christmas present! Our early one for you is 0.35. It's not a single thing inside a nice wrapping, more like several little gifts inside the 0.35 box.

This will be the last release of 2016 as our developers are taking a well deserved break. We will be back in 2017!

## <a class='title-link' name='text-to-speech' href='#text-to-speech'></a> Text to Speech 
With the addition of a [text-to-speech][tts] component by [@pvizeli] we have been able to bring Home Assistant to a whole new level. The text-to-speech component will take in any text and will play it on a media player that supports to play media. We have tested this on Sonos, Chromecast, and Google Home.

## <a class='title-link' name='call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image' href='#call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image'></a> Call for help with HASSbian (our Raspberry Pi image) 
In an effort to make Home Assistant, we're planning to extend the things that people can do out of the box with HASSbian, our Raspberry Pi image. As you might know, the image is currently maintained by [@Landrash]. However he also spends a lot of time on improving the docs and helping out with a ton of other things.

So if you know your Linux-foo and would love to contribute to open source, join the [Hassbian developer chat](https://gitter.im/home-assistant/hassbian) and take a stab at one of [our open issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/issues).

Let you control [VLC media player][vlc-media] and  play sound on connected speakers.

This Broadlink [switch][bl-switch] platform allow to you control Broadlink RM2 Pro and RM mini IR+RF devices. This Broadlink [sensor][bl-sensor] platform adds support for Broadlink RM2 and A1 Devices.

The [GPSLogger](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.gpslogger/) now also supports attributes as the speed, direction, altitude, provider, and activity.

    <updated>2016-12-03T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/03/remote-websockets-sonarr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Here we go... 0.34. Let's call it the "Santa Claus" release. Rudolph was faster than expected and there's lot's of goodies on the sleigh. Of course, more work on async programming done by [@pvizeli] and [@balloob], new components, new platforms, major improvements, and much more.

### <a class='title-link' name='gpslogger' href='#gpslogger'></a> GPSLogger 

The work of [@dainok] let's you use your Android device, with the Geolocation feature enabled, to track itself using GPS or WiFi networks with the [GPSLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger) app. GPSLogger can use multiple sources: the passive one just get the latest Android known location, without activating GPS sensors or scanning for WiFi networks.

###  <a class='title-link' name='remote-component' href='#remote-component'></a> Remote component 

The brand new [`remote`][remote] component made by [@iandday] will simplify the integration of all kinds of remote control units. The first platform for [Harmony][harmony] is included in this release.

### <a class='title-link' name='homematic' href='#homematic'></a> HomeMatic 

The [HomeMatic][homematic] component has received some updates worth mentioning:

* Additional services
  * `reconnect`: Reconnect to your CCU/Homegear without restarting Home Assistant.
  * `set_dev_value`: Manually control a device, even if it's not supported by Home Assistant yet.
* Support for multiple HomeMatic hosts
* Support for HomeMatic Wired (most devices) and HomeMatic IP (a few devices)
* Various improvements and fixes, especially for HM-Sec-Key (KeyMatic)

The support for multiple hosts is a result of allowing mixed configurations with wireless, wired, and IP devices. This has the drawback of making the update a breaking change (along with the renamed `set_value` service). However, the benefits and possibilities gained will be worth it.

### <a class='title-link' name='websocket-api' href='#websocket-api'></a> Websocket API 

This release includes a new [websockets][websockets] based API by [@balloob] to power the next generation of Home Assistant frontends. The current frontend has been partly migrated to use it and will be further migrated in the future.

## <a class='title-link' name='all-changes' href='#all-changes'></a> All changes

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0341---december-4' href='#release-0341---december-4'></a> Release 0.34.1 - December 4 

This release has a bunch of bug fixes including a big one: emulated_hue will now work with Google Home! We usually reserve patch releases for small bug fixes but we considered this more impactful bug fix so important that we're including it now instead of having people wait two weeks.

To make the fix backwards compatible (it is a patch release after all) you will have to add two new configuration option to emulated_hue to have it work with Google Home:

```yaml
emulated_hue:
  type: google_home
  # This is important. Sadly, Google Home will not work with other ports.
  listen_port: 80
```

We are working on a better solution for 0.35.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[For this release we put a lot of focus on finishing our async upgrade and fix a bunch of bugs in the process.

But a new release wouldn't be awesome if it didn't had some new goodies and this release is no different. This release includes a new calendar component by [@mnestor]. It comes now with Google Calendar support, which should allow you to automate things based on your calendar events!

 - Set executor pool size to 10 (as intended) ([@pvizeli])

This should fix occasional performance problems that some people have reported.

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 

 - We have included a fix that impacts how we generate entity ids. This only impacts devices with accented characters. Instead of being stripped out, they are now replaced with the non-accented version. So now `TÃ¨st MÃ¶rÃª` will become `test_more` instead of `tst_mr`.
 - Command line switches will now use the specified object ID for their entity ID instead of basing it off the name.

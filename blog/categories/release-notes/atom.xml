    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, after only nine days comes 0.30. Don't worry, we will try to keep our usual release cycle and not start to release every day.

We guess that you already know: The [Raspberry Pi image][pi-image] is available now. For Hassbian, [@Landrash] has combined the most essential parts for a Home Assistant setup in an easy-to-use image for the Raspberry Pi device family. Hassbian is quite young, thus we are looking forward to recieve [feedback][hassbian-forum], [issue report][hassbian-forum], and [suggestions][hassbian-forum] to improve it. 

A large amount of resources of the development are still focusing on the effort to move Home Assistant further to asynchronous programming. It's a labor-intensive task, comes with segmentation faults, and unstable instances when certain combinations of sensors are used. The benefit will be more speed in the near future.

To reduce the run-time of your tests, [@balloob] did a lot of tweaking. For now the RFXtrx tests are excluded which cut the needed time for running on your Pull Request in half. 

### <a class='title-link' name='documentation' href='#documentation'></a> Documentation 

All configuration sample entries are now minimized. This should help to avoid problem for starters and newbies as they only get what's needed and not a full sample with all optional entries. If there is an issue with an entry in your `configuration.yaml` file the error message will provide you an URL that point to the documentation.

  <img src='/images/screenshots/config-validation-url.png' />
</p>

As soon as the [Hacktoberfest] started there were a lot of incoming Pull Requests for the documentation. A huge "Thank you" to all participants. Especially, we would like to give a cookie to [@hillaryfraley]. She created around a dozen Pull Requests so far and didn't only fix typos but complete sections. The [Hacktoberfest] is still on-going and we are looking forward to get more Pull Requests.

### <a class='title-link' name='statistics' href='#statistics'></a> Statistics 

With the [statistics sensor][stats-sensor] we would like to introduce a new sensor that is similar to the [template sensor][template-sensor] or the [trend sensor][trend-sensor]. This sensor is consuming values from another sensor and is doing some statistical analysis of the data. Over a group of samples is the average/mean, the min/max, the total, the standard deviation, and the variance calculated which can be used in your automation rules. If the source is a binary sensor then the state changes are counted.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/stats-sensor.png' />
</p>

As the results are processed on-the-fly you still need to use the data from your database for a in-depth analysis of your stored information. Check the latest [notebook] for doing statistics with your Home Assistant database.

### <a class='title-link' name='rest-we-dont' href='#rest-we-dont'></a> REST! We don't... 

There was a lot of work done on our implementation which are working with RESTful APIs. [@w1ll1am23] extended the [aREST] platforms to display if an aREST unit is available or not. The aREST is now covered by the configuration check as well. Please check the Breaking changes section for more details.

The [REST sensor][rest-sensor] supports now HTTP authentication (basic and digest) and custom header. This will allow you to access resources which are protected. This sample sensor will access GitHub and retrieve the latest release number while by-passing the rate limit for non-authenticated requests.

```yaml
sensor
  - platform: rest
    resource: https://api.github.com/repos/home-assistant/home-assistant/releases/latest
    username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
    authentication: basic
    value_template: '{{ value_json.tag_name }}'
    headers:
      Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
      Content-Type: application/json
      User-Agent: Home Assistant REST sensor
```

### <a class='title-link' name='misc' href='#misc'></a> Misc 

- GitHub released with a recent update a review feature. This will give you more control over your comments while you review an open Pull Request.
- Thanks to [@robbiet480] we are now running [mention-bot]. It will help you when you create a new Pull Request to identify potential reviewers.
- The [Home Assistant Community Forum][forum] has now an additional section called "Installation".

    <updated>2016-09-29T03:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/09/29/async-sleepiq-emoncms-stocks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Two weeks ago, September 17 marked our 3 year anniversary. In this time Home Assistant managed to grow from a simple script that turned on my lights when the sun set to a kick ass open source project with the best community an open-source project could wish for. This release contains features, bug fixes and performance tweaks by a total of **50** different people! We have also managed to cross the 1000 forks on GitHub. Talking about momentum!

This is a big release as we've completely overhauled the internals of Home Assistant. When I initially wrote Home Assistant, still figuring out the ins and outs of Python, I went for an approach that I was familiar with for an application with many moving parts: threads and locks. This approach has served us well over the years but it was slower than it needed to be, especially on limited hardware.

This all changed when [@bbangert] came around and took on the tough job to migrate the core over to use asynchronous programming. He did an amazing job and I am happy to say that the initial port has been done and is included in this release! On top of that, we have been able to keep our simple and straightforward API at the same time. We are still in the process of migrating more and more components over to the asynchronous API, so expect more speedups and awesome features in the upcoming releases.

### <a class='title-link' name='sleepiq-and-openalpr' href='#sleepiq-and-openalpr'></a> SleepIQ and OpenALPR 

There now is support for two new super cool things: Beds and license plates. [@technicalpickles] created a [SleepIQ] component that let you monitor the sensor data of your bed. [@pvizeli] has added license plate recognition based on [OpenALPR]! This means that you can now be notified about which car is parked on your driveway or in your garage. I also would like to use this opportunity to give a big shoutout to [@pvizeli] for being such an awesome member of our community. He joined us at the end of June and has helped crush bugs and add awesome features ever since (65 pull requests already!).

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 

On the voluptuous front we have also made great progress. We were able to fully remove the legacy config helpers and have migrated 323 of the 346 components and platforms that needed migrating! This does mean that for some components the configuration has slightly changed, make sure to check out the breaking changes section at the bottom for more info. Thanks everybody for reviewing the Pull requests, testing the changes, and reporting issues.

### <a class='title-link' name='delayed-release' href='#delayed-release'></a> Delayed Release 

As you might have noticed, this release has been delayed by 5 days. This was due to a rare, difficult to reproduce problem with the Python interpreter. A huuuuge thanks to all the people that have helped countless hours in researching, debugging and fixing this issue: [@bbangert], [@turbokongen], [@lwis], [@kellerza], [@technicalpickles], [@pvizeli], [@persandstrom] and [@joyrider3774]. I am grateful to have all of you as part of the Home Assistant community.

### <a class='title-link' name='hide-automation-rules' href='#hide-automation-rules'></a> Hide automation rules 

Since 0.28 [automation rules](/blog/2016/09/10/notify-group-reload-api-pihole/#reload-automation-rules) can be reloaded directly from the frontend. By default all automation rules are shown. If you want to [hide an automation rule](/getting-started/automation-create-first/), use `hide_entity: True`.

This release brings you a huge improvement of the [automation] and [group] handling. Both can be reloaded without a Home Assistant restart by calling their new reload services. The automations can be controlled directly from the frontend.

### <a class='title-link' name='raspberry-pi-installation-guide' href='#raspberry-pi-installation-guide'></a> Raspberry Pi installation guide 
Singleboard computers are very popular to run Home Assistant. To support this fact, the [installation documentation][rpi] for the Raspberry Pi devices was re-written to get users started as quickly as possible. [@Landrash] took the lead with on this tasks with help from [@kellerza] and [@MartinHjelmare]. 

### <a class='title-link' name='climate-and--cover' href='#climate-and--cover'></a> Climate and  cover 
There are countless bugfixes included in this release which will make your experience with the `climate` and the `cover` platforms better. Two week ago was the biggest merger of implementations released that ever happened in the history of Home Assistant. Thanks to [@turbokongen], [@pvizeli], [@djbanks], [@danielperna84], and others the improvements on the code and the frontend side is continuing... 

### <a class='title-link' name='api-documentation' href='#api-documentation'></a> API documentation 
The [Home Assistant API Documentation](https://dev-docs.home-assistant.io/en/dev/) is a great addition to the already exisiting user documentation. The focus is not end-users but developers who whant to get details about the code without actually browsing the code on Github.

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 
The validation of the configuration is still on-going. Approximatly 80 % is done. This means that we will propably talk about this topic in the next release notes again. To align the configuration of components and platforms we needed to break some. Please refer to the Breaking changes section to check if you need to update your configuration or simple check your log for configuration validation errors. Thanks to [@kellerza], [@fabaff], [@Teagan42], and [@pvizeli] for your effort!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This week's blog post could only be possibly described by exactly one hashtag:

# #Amazing

<sup>or <sup>maybe<sup>#supersized</sup></sup></sup>

Keep reading to see what **#Amazing** things we have in store for you this week ð! And make sure you read all the way to the end, because I left a present down there for those committed few among you :)

But first...

## <a class='title-link' name='some-general-housekeeping' href='#some-general-housekeeping'></a> Some general housekeeping 

Paulus ([@balloob]) is on vacation in Europe this week, so you will all have to deal with me, Robbie ([@robbiet480]) for this release blog post. Don't worry, Paulus will be back to tearing apart your pull requests in no time ð.

Special thanks to my awesome helpers for this week's release who are looking over my shoulder to make sure I'm crossing my t's and dotting my i's: [@Teagan42], [@infamy] and [@fabaff].

For my next trick, let's hand out some...

## <a class='title-link' name='trophies' href='#trophies'></a> Trophies 

I felt that I had to 1-up Paulus ([@balloob]) somehow with his 500,000 pageviews stat he shared in the [0.26 blog post](/blog/2016/08/13/foursquare-fast-com-ffmpeg-gpsd/), so I pushed myself and our development community as a whole super hard the last two weeks to put a lot of love into Home Assistant to bring you not just one, but six **#Amazing** stats for this release. As of 0.27, we have now surpassed the following milestones:

* [10,000](https://travis-ci.org/home-assistant/home-assistant/builds/154660811) builds on Travis (congrats to [@BluGeni])
* [3,000](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/3000) issues and pull requests (thanks [@kellerza]!)
* [2,000](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/2991) pull requests alone (awesome [@fabaff]!!)
* 900 forks on Github!

In addition,

* We are very close to 4,000 stars on Github!
* [I'm now #5 contributor by most commits!!!](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/graphs/contributors) Hey wait, how'd this get in here ð³...

Now that we have that great news out of the way, onto this week's release which is going to keep the **#Amazing** gravy train rolling right along and get to the stuff you all _really_ are here for.

## <a class='title-link' name='027' href='#027'></a> 0.27 

While this release is **#Amazing**, we had to break a few eggs (now you understand the title reference!) to make a beautiful omelette (using home automation obviously) so some platforms and components have needed to introduce breaking changes. Please make sure to read the [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) section below.

### <a class='title-link' name='hue-bridge-emulation' href='#hue-bridge-emulation'></a> Hue Bridge Emulation 
Thanks to [@mgbowen] we now have the functionality previously provided by [@blocke]'s [ha-local-echo](https://github.com/blocke/ha-local-echo) [built right into Home Assistant](/components/emulated_hue/)! This means that for those of you with devices that either lack or have a subpar integration with Home Assistant (looking at you Amazon Echo) you can now have a better experience by having your Home Assistant pretend to be a Hue Bridge. Personally, I have used [@auchter]'s [Haaska](https://github.com/auchter/haaska) previously but found that it was slow to respond and sometimes failed entirely. With the new [`emulated_hue`](/components/emulated_hue/) component, you can have local control of entities through Amazon Echo.

### <a class='title-link' name='notification-improvements' href='#notification-improvements'></a> Notification improvements 
We have some excellent upgrades to the notification system coming to you in 0.27, courtesy of me, [@robbiet480].

#### <a class='title-link' name='html5-push-notifications' href='#html5-push-notifications'></a> HTML5 Push Notifications 
This release adds support for [HTML5] push notifications on Chrome/Firefox/Opera on both desktop and Android devices. This means that you can send a notification to your phone even when your Home Assistant is not open in your mobile browser. When using Chrome you can even include 2 action buttons so that you can control your Home Assistant from your phone's lock screen, allowing you to do things like sound alarms or unlock your front door, all without leaving the notification. Thanks again to me ([@robbiet480]) and Paulus ([@balloob]) for all the hard work on this!

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/html5-notify.png' />
</p>

#### <a class='title-link' name='notification-groups' href='#notification-groups'></a> Notification Groups 
Using the new notify `group` platform allows you to cut down a lot of duplicate automation logic by combining multiple notification platforms and `target`s into a single notify service. Check out the [docs](/components/notify.group/) for more info.

#### <a class='title-link' name='target-is-no-longer-needed' href='#target-is-no-longer-needed'></a> `target` is no longer needed! 
For platforms that support it, starting with the new HTML5 platform, any `target`s that are available will be exposed as individual services, so no more having to remember which `target`s to use. Please note that the existing services also still exist so you can keep using `target` if you wish.

### <a class='title-link' name='validate-configuration-before-restarting-home-assistant' href='#validate-configuration-before-restarting-home-assistant'></a> Validate configuration before restarting Home Assistant 
Ever restarted Home Assistant to test a configuration change just to find out there is a validation error? Well, not anymore! [@kellerza] has added a command line script that will validate your configuration as if you started Home Assistant.

```bash
$ hass --script check_config
```

### <a class='title-link' name='configuration-validation' href='#configuration-validation'></a> Configuration validation 
This release includes a big push on making sure all platforms contain proper configuration validation. This should help in getting your configuration right. Thanks to [@fabaff], [@pavoni], [@pvizeli], [@nkgilley] for all the hard work on this, you all rock!

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/screenshots/config-validation.png' />
</p>

### <a class='title-link' name='ffmpeg-motionnoise-sensing' href='#ffmpeg-motionnoise-sensing'></a> FFMpeg motion/noise sensing 
It's now possible to use [FFMpeg] to monitor a video stream and detect motion thanks to a new binary sensor platform by [@pvizeli].

### <a class='title-link' name='component-clean-up---thermostat--hvac---climate-rollershutter--garage-door---cover' href='#component-clean-up---thermostat--hvac---climate-rollershutter--garage-door---cover'></a> Component clean up - Thermostat & HVAC -> Climate. Rollershutter & Garage Door -> Cover. 
Due to our wild growth we ended up with a few components that had a lot of overlapping functionality. [@turbokongen] took on the hard job on merging them. Thermostat and HVAC platforms are now combined under the new Climate component. Rollershutter and Garage Door platforms are now combined under the new Cover component. You can easily upgrade by just swapping out the name. For example replace `thermostat` with `climate`. The old components have been deprecated and will be removed in the near future.

### <a class='title-link' name='a-new-fan-component' href='#a-new-fan-component'></a> A new `fan` component 
Along with the new `climate` component, [@Teagan42] and I ([@robbiet480]) decided we needed something simpler to just control a fan. Currently it has support for controlling Insteon fans. MQTT support will appear in 0.28.0. I tried to get it implemented before 0.27.0 but spent too long writing this blog post ð¢.

### <a class='title-link' name='all-changes' href='#all-changes'></a> All changes

## <a class='title-link' name='finishing-up' href='#finishing-up'></a> Finishing up 

Thanks all for sticking with me to the end. I'll be taking over a lot of Paulus's ([@balloob]) work while he is gone, but as I said, don't worry because he'll be back well before 0.28.0 comes out. Hopefully you didn't find this jovial blog post too jarring from our standard style, I just wrote a lot of this at 2am after being awake for almost 20 hours, so I'm a little loopy hahaha ð´.

Also, thanks as always to our developer contributors, documentation contributors, but most of all our users! This would've just been a script that Paulus (@balloob) used to control his lights at home if we didn't have your enthusiasm.

Feel free to let me know what you thought of this blog post and release on Gitter or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robbie), or even the [Home Assistant Twitter](https://twitter.com/home_assistant). Did I mention we have a brand new [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/homeassistantio) that you should absolutely Like? There's a convenient Facebook Like and Twitter follow button right on the sidebar.

I almost forgot about your ð for reading all the way to here: a ðª! Hope you enjoy it in good health ð.

Talk to you soon on Gitter and in your pull request comments!

-- Robbie

(p.s. To those of you that scrolled directly to the bottom to get your present, just know that you didn't earn it like the others did. ð)

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[It's time for 0.26 and it's again full of new features and fixes. First I want to highlight that we are now having 500 000 monthly pageviews on the website. A big milestone for us! It's been an amazing journey. Big thanks to the Home Assistant community for being such a delightful bunch.

This release includes code contributed by 31 different people. The biggest change in this release is a new unit system. Instead of picking Celsius or Fahrenheit you'll have to pick imperial or metric now. This influences the units for your temperature, distance, and weight. This will simplify any platform or component that needs to know this information. Big thanks to [@Teagan42] for her hard work on this!

 - A new unit system has superseded the temperature unit option in the core configuration. For now it is backwards compatible, but you should update soon:

```yaml
# Configuration.yaml example
homeassistant:
  # 'metric' for the metric system, 'imperial' for the imperial system
  unit_system: metric
```

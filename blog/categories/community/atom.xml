    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In just 12 hours PyCon US 2017 starts. This is an exciting conference because there will be a bunch of Home Assistant developers and users there being able to meet in person.

Just like last year, we'll be hosting a [Home Assistant Open Space](https://us.pycon.org/2017/events/open-spaces/). Please stop by to ask any questions you have to the available developers. ~~We haven't reserved a slot yet but will do so tomorrow. We'll update this post and announce it on social media as we know time and location.~~ **First open-space will be Friday at 4pm in room B112.**

We will also be taken part in the [development sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2017/community/sprints/) from Monday-Wednesday. You only need to bring a laptop. We'll help you get set up with a dev environment and you can be coding on top of Home Assistant in no time. ~~Exact location inside the conference center to be announced.~~ **We are sitting in room A108.**

On a final note, the Home Assistant community is very very active so don't take it personal if we don't remember your name, issue or contribution.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I like Python. It's a clean easy to read, easy to learn language. Yet when you use it for some time you still find more features to improve your coding. What I probably like most about Python is the community and the great libraries that already exist. Often solving a problem means including a pre-existing library and writing some glue code. That makes it quick to get things up and running.

I just gave a talk on how you can run Python to automate your home (yes with Home-Assistant) but also with [MicroPython]. Micropython allows you to run Python on your DIY sensors and switches around your home. Python everywhere - even on the chips that give Home-Assistant the data to be awesome.

Earlier this year I was interviewed by Tobias Macey from [Podcast.\_\_init\_\_][pc-init] about Python and Home Assistant. Just realized that we never shared this on the blog, oops. Here it is, enjoy!

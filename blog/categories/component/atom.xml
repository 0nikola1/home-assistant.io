    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For thet majority of its existence, Home Assistant primary focus was on presence detection, lights and switches. But not anymore as we&rsquo;re expanding the supported devices. Today, we&rsquo;re proud to introduce Nest Thermostat integration for Home Assistant contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sfiorini">Stefano Fiorini</a>!</p>

</p>


<p>The new integration exists out of two parts: a generic thermostat component and a Nest platform implementation. The initial version implements provides a read-only card and services to control it. The plan is in the future to add temperature and away mode controls from the thermostat card and more info dialog. Internally, we are using the Python package <a href="https://github.com/jkoelker/python-nest">python-nest by jkoelker</a> to talk to the Nest.</p>

<p>If you own a Nest thermostat, add the following lines to your <code>home-assistant.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[thermostat]
platform=nest
username=YOUR_USERNAME
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most people do not like configuring things. Things just have to work, out of the box. Reaching this scenario is the goal of what we are about to introduce: our new discovery component.</p>

<p>The discovery component will scan the WiFi network from time to time for connected zeroconf/mDNS and uPnP devices. The intial introduction is mainly focussed on getting the right architecture in place and discovers Belkin WeMo switches and Google Chromecasts connected to your network. When found, it will load and notify the appropritate component and it will be ready to use within seconds.</p>

<p>Most devices still require some sort of interaction from the user after being discovered - be it a button being pressed or some sort of authentication. This is a challenge that will be solved in the future.</p>

<p>To enable the discovery component, add the following to your <code>home-assistant.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[discovery]
</code></pre>

<p>A new <a href="/developers/add_new_platform.html#discovery">discovery section</a> has been added to the Adding a new platform page with instructions how to make your platform discoverable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that was missing in Home Assistant for a while was a way to communicate with users. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to get a message when important events happen like the lights being turned on while no one is home? Since the Home Assistant frontend runs as a web application on the phone, we have no way to bring ourselves to the front. This is where the new notify component comes in, powered by PushBullet.</p>

<p>The new notify component will take in messages and tells them to the user. For now this will be powered by the very awesome <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a> but any other messaging platform can be easily added.</p>

<p>Read on to learn how to enable the notify component and integrate it with other components.</p>

<h3>Enabling the notify component</h3>

<p>To enable the new notify component, add the following to your <code>home-assistant.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[notify]
platform=pushbullet
api_key=ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ
</code></pre>

<p>You can get your api key from <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/account">your account page on PushBullet.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Sending messages from your component</h3>

<p>To be able to send messages, the notify component has to be loaded and initialized successfully.</p>

<pre><code class="python">import homeassistant.loader as loader

def setup(hass, config):
    notify = loader.get_component('notify')
    notify.send_message(hass, "Hello from my component!")
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As Home Assistant is gaining more and more users we started to feel the pain from not having a
proper release mechanism. We had no version numbering and required users to checkout the source
using Git to get started. On top of that, as the number of devices that we support keeps raising, so
did the number of dependencies that are used. That&rsquo;s why we decided to change the way we roll. From
now on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each release will have a version number, starting with version 0.7. This was chosen because it
shows that we have been around for some time but are not considering ourselves to be fully
stable.</li>
<li>Each release will be pushed to PyPi. This will be the only supported method of distribution.</li>
<li>Home Assistant is available after installation as a command-line utility <code>hass</code>.</li>
<li>The default configuration location has been moved from <code>config</code> in the current working directory
to <code>~/.homeassistant</code> (<code>%APPDATA%/.homeassistant</code> on Windows).</li>
<li>Requirements for components and platforms are no longer installed into the current Python
environment (being virtual or not) but will be installed in <code>&lt;config-dir&gt;/lib</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>A huge shout out to <a href="https://github.com/rmkraus">Ryan Kraus</a> for making this all possible. Please
make sure you read <a href="/blog/2015/08/31/version-7-revamped-ui-and-improved-distribution/#read-more">the full blog post</a> for details on how to migrate your existing setup.</p>

<p>And while Ryan was fixing distribution, I have been hard at work in giving Home Assistant a face
lift. We already looked pretty good but lacked proper form of organization for users with many
devices. The new UI moves away from a card per entity and has cards per group and domain instead.
<a href="/demo/">The demo</a> has been updated so give it a spin.</p>

<h3><a class='title-link' name='migration-to-version-07' href='#migration-to-version-07'></a> Migration to version 0.7 </h3>

<p>For this example, let&rsquo;s say we have an old Home Assistant installation in
<code>/home/paulus/home-assistant</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to migrate your existing configuration to be used as the default configuration:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">cp -r /home/paulus/home-assistant ~/.homeassistant
</code></pre>

<p>It If you want to have the configuration in a different location, for example
<code>/home/paulus/home-assistant-config</code>, you will have to point Home Assistant at this configuration
folder when launching:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">hass --config /home/paulus/home-assistant-config
</code></pre>

<a href="https://github.com/sfam">@sfam</a> has blessed us with two more MQTT platforms to extend our
integration with MQTTT: <a href="/components/sensor.mqtt.html">sensor</a> and <a href="/components/switch.mqtt.html">switch</a>. Both platforms require the
MQTT component to be connected to a broker.</p>

    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2015/08/26/laundry-automation-with-moteino-mqtt-and-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post by Home Assistant user and contributor <a href="https://github.com/nkgilley">Nolan Gilley</a>.</em></p>

<p>In our house, laundry has been a struggle for quite some time.  Our washer and dryer both lack a buzzer which leads to forgotten laundry, and stinky mess that needs to be rewashed.  I decided to create a solution by monitoring the washer and dryer myself with some cheap electronics.</p>

<p>As an avid user of Home Assistant, I decided it would be the perfect application to manage the UI and notification system.  Now all I needed was a way to monitor the washer and dryer.  I tried using sound sensors but found them unreliable.  I ended up opting for an accelerometer attached to the back of each appliance.  I also added magnetic reed switches on the doors of the washer and dryer to detect if the doors are open or closed.  I connected the accelerometers and reed switches to a <a href="https://lowpowerlab.com/moteino/">Moteino</a>, an arduino clone with an RF transceiver.  The Moteino can perform the logic to figure out which state the appliances are in and wirelessly communicate that data with another Moteino that is connected via serial to my Raspberry Pi.  The Raspberry Pi reads the serial data and repeats it over MQTT for Home Assistant to use.  This is great because I don&rsquo;t have to run Home Assistant on the Raspberry Pi.  I can run it on a faster machine and point the <a href="/components/mqtt.html">MQTT component</a> to my Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>After taking some sample data from the accelerometers while each appliance was in operation, I decided to plot the data to help determine the proper thresholds of when the devices were running or off.  I had to do this in order to get precise ranges so the dryer sensor wouldn&rsquo;t get tripped by the washer or vice versa.  In the plot below you can see the acceleration in the x direction for the accelerometer connected to the washing machine.   It&rsquo;s easy to see when the washing machine is in operation here.  I used the same technique for the dryer&rsquo;s accelerometer.</p>

<p>Next it was just a matter of integrating everything with Home Assistant.  I was able to use the <a href="/components/mqtt.html">MQTT component</a> to read the washer and dryer states from the Moteino and display it in Home Assistant.</p>

<p>Next I wrote <a href="/components/script.html">scripts</a> that are run whenever the washer or dryer completes a load.  This is triggered by the <a href="/components/automation.html">automation component</a>.  When the laundry is complete I have the lights in the house turn red and <a href="/components/notify.pushbullet.html">notify me via PushBullet</a>.  Once the laundry is taken care of another script runs that sets the lights back to normal.  So far it has been very helpful and very reliable.</p>
